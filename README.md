# Developers Guide
This repository contains the Developers Guide for all repositories that make up [NJOY](https://https://github.com/njoy).

# Website stuff
This is a fork (copy) of [jekyll-website](https://github.com/njoy/jekyll-website) with local modifications. Making this a copy of jekyll-website allows us to keep a consistent look across all the projects in [NJOY](https://github.com/njoy).

## Updates
To update to whatever changes are made in jekyll-website, that repository must be set as remote repository and any changes there can be `pull`-ed into this one. **You should *never* `push` from this repository back to jekyll-website.**
