NJOY has a long history of collaboration from individuals and institutions from outside Los Alamos National Laboratory. With the development of NJOY21, we hope to continue to work with outside developers to improve the quality and capabilities of NJOY21. You can find a list of our goals [here](https://njoy.github.io/about/Goals.html).

This is the Developer's Guide for NJOY21, which includes the programming [style](Style/) expected for all code contributed to NJOY21. If you look closely, you will find instances where LANL developers don't strictly follow the style guide. This is due to the fact that the style guide has been modified since the original code was written or the project has not been updated to the most recent standards. **Don't use exisiting code as an excuse not to follow the style.**
